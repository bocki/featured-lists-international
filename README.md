# Spotify's Featured Playlists from around the world

Spotify has a lot of curated playlists. Unfortunately, you're locked into the selection made especially for your country. Don't like "German Schlager"? Can't stand the "Â¡Viva Latino!" playlist anymore? What the heck is "Top Christian Contemporary", anyway? Too bad, you're stuck with the market you subscribed to.

This small HTML file will allow you to select a country and show its currently featured playlists. Login through Spotify is needed because the API endpoint needs authorization.

## Current features

* Select any of Spotify's supported regions (Countries without any curated lists will eventually get removed)
* Shows all featured playlists and the current flavour text for the time of day
* Clicking on an item will open Spotify web player on desktop and the app on mobile

## Suggestions?

I'm not a programmer, so code might be messy, features might be missing, there might be bugs. Pull requests and any other ideas are always appreciated!
